    <div class="sectionright"><p>According to Statista Market Researchâ†—, the board game industry is valued at a shocking $11 billion today and is growing at a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/board-games-market-value-is-set-to-grow-by-usd-3-02-billion-from-2021-to-2026--increasing-digitization-of-board-games-to-be-the-premium-trend-301598692.html">rate of 7-8%.</a>
        For reference, see how board games compare with other billion dollar industries today. <div class="flourish-embed flourish-hierarchy" data-src="visualisation/21429155"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script><noscript><img src="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/21429155/thumbnail" width="100%" alt="hierarchy visualization" /></noscript></div>
    <br><span class="caption">Source: Boardgamegeek.com</span><br><p>Boardgamegeek is the top English language website for cataloging board games, even if we expand our data to include the top 25,000 games, we find that the majority were published recently.</p>

    <div class="sectionleft"><h4>A New Era of Board Games</h4></div>
    <div class="sectionright"><p>Sales data would probably still show games like Chess and Monopoly at the top of the charts, but modern board games are more diverse than ever before. You can now terraform mars, create environments for adorable birds, or survive prehistoric times playing as our cave ancestors.<br></p>

        <p>When looking at just the top 1000 games today, the top categories today are: fantasy, card game, and economic.<br></p>

        <p>On the flip side, when looking at the top 1000 games, it's not as clear which mechanics are most likely to be seen. People are interested in a diverse set of mechanics but popularity of categories or themes are more likely.</p><br>

        <br><span class="caption">Source: Boardgamegeek.com</span><br> 
        <p>We can also see that the categories published in games have changed significantly over time, as is the case for wargames (decrease), fantasy (increased), and card games (increase).</p><br>

    <div class="sectionleft"><h4>Average Rating on Boardgamegeek</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="sectionright"><p>Bestsellers like Connect 4, Trouble, and Sorry, don't overlap with ratings on Boardgamegeek. Those bestsellers in particular were catered to younger audiences whereas today the highest ratest games have a sweet spot of minimum age of 12.5.<br></p>
        <p>The trait that correlates most clearly with rating on board game geek, however, is board game complexity. Sounds like we're all a bunch of nerds, I'm quite alright with this label.</p>
